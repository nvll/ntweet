This is an ncurses based twitter reader I wrote back in 2008. The code was never polished, probably leaks memory and does not work with modern twitter apis. If I recall, it was the first time I had used glib, curl, ncurses and libxml. I've cleaned up the code a bit to make it more presentable but nothing more.
